Password Complexity Checker
Build a tool that assesses the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Provide feedback to users on the password's strength.

Here's a simple Python code for a Password Complexity Checker. This code defines a function 'check_password_complexity' that takes a password as input and checks its complexity based on length, uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. The 'main' function gets user input for a password and prints the result of the complexity check.



To creat the password  , import re function.
The re is a regular expression (or RE) specifies a set of strings that matches it; the functions  let you check if a particular string matches a given regular expression (or if a given regular expression matches a particular string, which comes down to the same thing).
